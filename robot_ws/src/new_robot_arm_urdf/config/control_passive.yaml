# Passive Control - No Active Controllers (No Shaking)
# Robot will be controlled via direct Gazebo model state manipulation

# Only joint state controller for feedback

# No active position/effort controllers - prevents oscillation
# RL environment will control robot via:
# 1. Direct joint position setting via Gazebo services
# 2. Or physics-based force application
